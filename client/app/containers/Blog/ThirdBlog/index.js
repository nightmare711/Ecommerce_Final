          <p className='blog__para'>Ok, after understanding what Bitcoin is, it's time for you to ask the question "I want to play Bitcoin, how should I start?"</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>There are 9 ways you can play Bitcoin including:</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>1. Buy Bitcoin to store (Recommended for newbies without much experience) wait for the price to rise and then sell again</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>2. Deposit in coins to get more interest and earn more coins.</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>3. Buy Bitcoin to Trade (use Bitcoin to buy other coins like Ethereum, Binance Coin… to make more profit)</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>4. Margin trading with up to 100x leverage (this way offers huge profits but also huge risks)</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>5. Bitcoin Mining (for those of you who have a bit more in-depth knowledge of Bitcoin)</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>6. Invest in Binance Launchpool (recommended, it's free)</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>7. Invest in Binance Launchpad (IEO fundraising projects)</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>8. Invest in Etoro (can be used to trade Bitcoin and other securities in the world)</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>9. Invest in DEFI – Decentralized Finance (NEW)</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>Please note that there are 9 ways for you to invest in Bitcoin as above, you can choose 1 of the 9 ways above or choose many ways. Depending on each way, you will choose an effective way to play Bitcoin for yourself, in the title of each way, I will add the accompanying keyword "this is how to play bitcoin effectively", so you can focus more more on it to get better profit. Now we will go into detail each way to play Bitcoin.</p>
          <p className='blog__title'>Buy Bitcoin for storage</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>This is the most popular Bitcoin beginner's guide and in my opinion this is also the most effective way to play, and since you don't have much experience, I encourage you to do it this way.</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>This way is simply you spend money to buy some amount of Bitcoin. For example, today you spend money to buy 1 Bitcoin for 200 million, after 1 year Bitcoin increases in price to 300 million, then you sell you will make a profit of 100 million. It is as simple as you buy and sell gold, buy it, sell it at a profit. And you can sell whenever you want, as long as you find it profitable to sell. And you also need to note that you do not need to buy 1 Bitcoin whole, but you can buy 0.1 or 0.001 BTC.</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>To store Bitcoin, you need to follow these steps:</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>1. A bank account such as Vietcombank (recommended), Techcombank, ACB, etc...and these accounts must have Internet Banking function to pay online as I mentioned above.</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>2. Your next job is that you will need to create a Bitcoin wallet to store Bitcoins. Currently, there are many services that allow creating Bitcoin wallets for storage such as Binance wallet, Remitano, CoinBase, Exodus, .. Actually calling wallet creation sounds complicated, but most of the steps to create a wallet are automatic. end. You just need to register for an exchange account like Remitano, Binance to trade coins, it also has a built-in wallet in it, no need to do anything more complicated.</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>3. Once you have a bank account, the next thing you need to do is find a place where you can use the money from your card to buy Bitcoin and put it in your wallet to store it. Currently there are many sites that allow you to buy Bitcoin, but since you are a newbie, I encourage you to use Remitano to quickly buy 1 of 7 coins (BTC, ETH, USDT, LTC, XRP, BCH, BNB). This is an old and reputable Bitcoin exchange in Vietnam. In addition, the exchange also supports buying and selling Bitcoin for friends abroad such as the US, Australia, etc. See instructions for buying Bitcoin with Remitano</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>4. So you can buy Bitcoin and store it with the 3 steps above. In addition, you can also refer to how to buy Bitcoin, USDT, BNB, ... with a bank account via Binance P2P (this is a function of the Binance exchange that also supports buying coins with a bank account). Here the price will be a bit better than on Remitano (See instructions to buy Bitcoin on Binance P2P)</p>

          <h3 className='video__title'>Video: An introduction to how Remitano works</h3>
          <p className='blog__title'>Deposit with Coin</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>This is a very good channel and I am very excited to share it with you. Because this is a way to help you increase the number of coins you hold.</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>If you store Bitcoin in the usual way, buy it and keep it in Bitcoin wallets, then as time goes on, your number of Bitcoins will remain the same, not increase. But for this channel, it will pay you interest in Bitcoin, that is, if you deposit in Bitcoin, you will receive interest in Bitcoin, and thus increase the number of Bitcoins for you.</p>
          <div className='author__thought'>
            <p className='author__comment'>
              I take this example for you to understand easily. Assuming the number 1 way is to buy Bitcoin to store, then today you buy 1 Bitcoin for 200 million, after 1 year, Bitcoin will increase to 300 million. Then when you sell, you will make a profit of 100 million (300 million - 200 million = 100 million).
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className='author__thought'>
            <p className='author__comment'>
              But with this Bitcoin saving method, you will receive more interest converted into Bitcoin. For example, you buy 1 Bitcoin for 200 million, and you save the newly purchased Bitcoin with an interest rate of 8%/year. Then after one year, the amount you will receive is: (1 Bitcoin + 0.08 Bitcoin profit) x 300 million = 324 million. Thus, you get compound interest, both profit from Bitcoin's price increase and interest from interest paid from Bitcoin with an amount of 124 million (324 million - 200 million = 124 million).
            </p>
          </div>
          <p className='blog__title'>Buy Bitcoin to Trade</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>Buying Bitcoin to Trade means you will buy an amount of Bitcoin and you use Bitcoin to buy other coins (collectively, Altcoins) such as Ethereum, OmiseGo, etc. In case the price increase of these Altcoins increases faster. Bitcoin's growth rate, you sell Bitcoin back to make a profit.</p>
          <div className='author__thought'>
            <p className='author__comment'>
            For example, for example, you have 1 Bitcoin and you use this 1 Bitcoin to buy 30 Ethereum coins. After 2 months, the price of Bitcoin increased by 10%, the price of Ethereum increased by 30%, which means that the price of Ethereum has increased more strongly than Bitcoin at this time. Then you sell Ethereum back to Bitcoin, you will own more Bitcoins. Basically trading it is like that.

          <p className='blog__title'>Margin Trading Guide</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>Margin is also known as margin trading, ie you borrow money from the exchange to be able to trade with large orders. In a word, for example, you only have 500 usd, but you want to place an order of 5000 usd, you will not have enough money, so the exchange will lend you 4500 usd so that you have enough money is 5000 usd to make that transaction.</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>But as you know, when you borrow money from people, if you do good business, you will have great profits, but if you borrow money from people and you do business at a loss, the profit you pay will be many times over. And margin trading is similar, you borrow money from the floor to trade, if the trade wins, you will have a lot of profit, and if the trade loses, you will pay back the debt amount many times. It's basically like that :).</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>With margin trading, the most famous are Binance Future exchanges (Binance's Margin function) and Bitmex. Currently, Binance has supported leverage up to 125x, and Bitmex 100x. That is, you can borrow up to 125 times the floor money you currently have. For example, if you have 100 usd, you can borrow 125 times the floor, you can place an order of 12,500 usd with 100x leverage.</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>You can trade margin on Binance itself (Binance Future) for your convenience, or, if you want, you can also use Bitmex.</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>Margin trading brings great profits but also comes with great risks, so you need to consider your decisions before.</p>
          <p className='blog__title'>Mining Bitcoin</p>
          <p className='blog__para'>Bitcoin Mining is the 5th Bitcoin tutorial that I would recommend to you. Bitcoin mining is a method of earning Bitcoin by using computers and graphics cards with strong processing speed to solve algorithms that are jobs received from pools. The more powerful the computer, the more algorithms you solve, the more Bitcoin rewards you will receive.</p>
          <p className='blog__title'>Join Binance Launchpool</p>

          <p className='blog__para'>- If you have the ability to learn technical analysis, see charts, and candles, you can participate in trading coins on exchanges (3rd Bitcoin tutorial) to earn more profits. However, you should play within the allowed level, do not invest too much property in the coin, only invest the amount you can accept to lose without affecting your current life.</p>
