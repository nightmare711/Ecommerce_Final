            One more thing I want to say is that many of you complain about me that why I use the word "play Bitcoin" but not "invest Bitcoin" because using the word play shows not being serious, I would also like to say to all of you. You are me I use the word play because this is an article I wrote a long time ago, at that time the word playing Bitcoin was more popular than investing in Bitcoin, so I used it to make it easier for you to find my article, just simple. simply that. Moreover, what is important is the content of the article, but what is the importance of the word "play" or "investment", right?
